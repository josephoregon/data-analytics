  <h1>NBA Analytics | Web Scraping </h1>
  <br />
  <hr>
  <div align="justify">
    <p>
      Here is my soft introduction to my NBA Analytics Python project. The dataset used in this project are results of web scraping
      through a popular Python package called
      <a href="http://selenium-python.readthedocs.io" target="_blank">Selenium</a>. I put this module to work on sports-related websites such as
      <a href="http://www.espn.com" target="_blank">ESPN.com</a> and
      <a href="https://stats.nba.com" target="_blank">Stats.NBA.com</a>.
    </p>
    <h4>The Right Tools</h4>
    <p>
      I have spent many hours on choosing the right tools through trial and error methods. I use a MacBook Pro for my work, so
      some of the tools I would initially choose were not compatible and this would force me to find a different tool that
      could do the same thing. After finally deciding that I will complete this project through a cloud databse, I began
      to look at other tools that would help me complete the rest of my objective. I explored with AWS, Azure, Jupyter Notebook,
      PyCharm, Visual Studio Code, Sublime, Nbviewer, and many extensions offered with some of these popular tools. Eventually
      I came down to a set I preferred among others and that accomplished what I needed while developing this project.
    </p>
    <p>
      The the cloud database platform I decided to use was
      <b>Microsoft Azure</b> and for several reasons. Azure offered simplicity (over AWS), integration ease, and most of all,
      free services that come with a student account. I started off performing my code in
      <b>Jupyter Notebook</b>, but noticed that a lot of way to do things with flask and other tools were not possible with
      this platform. I then tried PyCharm and VisualStudio to find something more suitable. When compared to Jupyter's platform,
      these two appeared to be very clunky (although both have many more capabilities). I made my way back to Jupyter and
      began to research workarounds. As for the last tool (editor), it came down to choosing something that could interact
      well with Jupyter. When I was not using Python code in Jupyter (mainly HTML) I wanted something a little more intuitive.
      This is where I started using
      <b>Visual Studio Code</b> to make my .html file edits.
    </p>
    <h4>Web Scraping</h4>
    <p>This was by far the biggest challenge! It was suggested to use an API to gather my data, but I was determined to produce
      my own data from popular websites such as
      <a href="http://www.espn.com/" target="_blank">ESPN.com</a> and
      <a href="http://stats.nba.com/" target="_blank">Stats.NBA.com</a> - The web scraping research started with learning in detail how another individual did something
      similar I had planned. I used the
      <a href="https://nycdatascience.com/blog/student-works/web-scraping/web-scraping-nba-stats/" target="blank">foundations of his code</a> foundations of his code and started building my own web scraping script. As I began to
      build my own, I change a lot of the foundational code to something that would meet my needs better.
    </p>
    <h4>The Results</h4>
    <p>
      I was able to produce decent looking files that gave me opportunities to create insightful data analytics. I created three
      different .ipynb (Jupyter's Notebook Extension) files. Below are links that lead to the files and a description of
      what they are being used for.

    <h4>
      <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/josephoregon/data-analytics/blob/master/nba_scrap.ipynb" target="_blank">nba_scrap.ipynb</a>
    </h4>
    <p>
      This notebook was created for the purpose of web scraping the websites and the foundations to other notebooks. This notebook
      does not connect with the other two, but I will warn you that a lot of the code is messy and redundant. I decided to
      not change my initial way of coding this project to see the improvement when making it better in the next two notebooks.
      That being said, there is so much room for improvement regardless of my progress.

      This notebook where I wanted to make my functions, classes, and importing the goods with efficient code. And I was able to
      accomplish this feat as much as a novice programmer could (still working on the codes). I also did extra research to
      find out how one could use this .ipynb file as a module for another .ipynb file. I was able to do this by including
      a few code functions that were officially
      <a href="http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Notebook/Importing%20Notebooks.html" target="_blank">documented by Jupyter themselves</a>.

      The analytics of my work, although minimal, is stored within this notebook. I have yet to find a decent combination of my
      features to develop a visual that is worth looking at with immediate insight among the data I have collected. Here
      are a few screen shots of my analytical code.
