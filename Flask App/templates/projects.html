  <h1>NBA Analytics | Web Scraping </h1>
  <br />
  <hr>
  <div align="justify">
    <p>
      Here is my soft introduction to my NBA Analytics Python project. The dataset used in this project are results of web scraping
      through a popular Python package called
      <a href="http://selenium-python.readthedocs.io">Selenium</a>. I put this module to work on sports-related websites such as
      <a href="http://www.espn.com">ESPN.com</a> and
      <a href="https://stats.nba.com">Stats.NBA.com</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>The Right Tools</h3>
    <p>
      I have spent many hours on choosing the right tools through trial and error methods. I use a MacBook Pro for my work, so
      some of the tools I would initially choose were not compatible and this would force me to find a different tool that
      could do the same thing. After finally deciding that I will complete this project through a cloud databse, I began
      to look at other tools that would help me complete the rest of my objective. I explored with AWS, Azure, Jupyter Notebook,
      PyCharm, Visual Studio Code, Sublime, Nbviewer, and many extensions offered with some of these popular tools. Eventually
      I came down to a set I preferred among others and that accomplished what I needed while developing this project.
    </p>
    <p>
      The the cloud database platform I decided to use was
      <b>Microsoft Azure</b> and for several reasons. Azure offered simplicity (over AWS), integration ease, and most of all,
      free services that come with a student account. I started off performing my code in
      <b>Jupyter Notebook</b>, but noticed that a lot of way to do things with flask and other tools were not possible with
      this platform. I then tried PyCharm and VisualStudio to find something more suitable. When compared to Jupyter's platform,
      these two appeared to be very clunky (although both have many more capabilities). I made my way back to Jupyter and
      began to research workarounds. As for the last tool (editor), it came down to choosing something that could interact
      well with Jupyter. When I was not using Python code in Jupyter (mainly HTML) I wanted something a little more intuitive.
      This is where I started using
      <b>Visual Studio Code</b> to make my .html file edits.
      <h3>Web Scraping</h3>

      <p>This was by far the biggest challenge! It was suggested to use an API to gather my data, but I was determined to produce
        my own data from popular websites such as
        <a href="http://www.espn.com/" target="blank">ESPN.com</a> and
        <a href="http://stats.nba.com/" target="blank">Stats.NBA.com</a> - The web scraping research started with learning in detail how another individual did something
        similar I had planned. I used the
        <a href="https://nycdatascience.com/blog/student-works/web-scraping/web-scraping-nba-stats/" target="blank">foundations of his code</a> foundations of his code and started building my own web scraping script. As I began to
        build my own, I change a lot of the foundational code to something that would meet my needs better.
      </p>
      <h3>The Results</h3>
      <p>
        I was able to produce decent looking files that gave me opportunities to create insightful data analytics. Below are a few
        screenshots of my completed code while using created tables with Python's
        <b>pandas</b> to create DataFrame within Jupyter.
